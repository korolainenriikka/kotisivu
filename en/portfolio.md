# Portfolio

By the meaning of the title: this page contains all I have done in the years past. This means the full history of my software projects, with all the twists and turns, finished, semi-finished and unfinished parts.

Given the completeness of this record this can also be seens as a full look into my GitHub, so this provides a better look there as well, as code with its projet context might be more useful to look at.

So, I hope that this look into history will be useful to its reader!
