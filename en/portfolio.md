# Portfolio

By the meaning of the title: this page contains all I have done in the years past. This means the full history of my software projects, with all the twists and turns, finished, semi-finished and unfinished parts.

Given the completeness of this record this can also be seens as a full look into my GitHub, so this provides a better look there as well, as code with its projet context might be more useful to look at.

<button id='purchase'>klik me</button>
<script>
    document.getElementById("purchase").addEventListener("click", function () {
          gtag("event", "purchase", {
        transaction_id: "T_12345",
        affiliation: "Google Merchandise Store",
        value: 25.42,
        tax: 4.90,
        shipping: 5.99,
        currency: "USD",
        coupon: "SUMMER_SALE",
        items: [
        // If someone purchases more than one item, 
        // you can add those items to the items array
         {
          item_id: "SKU_12345",
          item_name: "Stan and Friends Tee",
          affiliation: "Google Merchandise Store",
          coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
          currency: "USD",
          discount: 2.22,
          index: 0,
          item_brand: "Google",
          item_category: "Apparel",
          item_category2: "Adult",
          item_category3: "Shirts",
          item_category4: "Crew",
          item_category5: "Short sleeve",
          item_list_id: "related_products",
          item_list_name: "Related Products",
          item_variant: "green",
          location_id: "L_12345",
          price: 9.99,
          quantity: 1
        }]
    });
        });
      });
    </script>


So, I hope that this look into history will be useful to its reader!
